# ISS App
This web app allows users to learn facts about the International Space Station with an interactive map that shows what part of the world the ISS is flying over in real time.
After logging in, users can add, delete, and favorite space pictures to a database and see them displayed. It also features a page that shows information about different astronaut crews by mission.

It was developed in 2 1/2 weeks!
